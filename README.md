# ðŸ©º Diabetes_Prediction_Using_ML

Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders
characterized by a high blood sugar level over a prolonged period of time.
In this project, We will be analysing DM and based on the analysis of the disorder and the
dataset collected, Weâ€™ll build a machine learning model for the diabetes prediction.

ðŸ§©Procedure of Proposed Methodology:
Step1: Import required libraries, Import diabetes dataset.
Step2: Pre-process data to remove missing data/Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Step3: Perform a percentage split of 80% to divide dataset as Training set and 20% to Test set.
Step4: Select the machine learning algorithm i.e. K- Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Naive Bayes
and Random Forest.
Step5: Build the classifier model for the mentioned machine learning algorithm based on the
training set.
Step6: Test the Classifier model for the mentioned machine learning algorithm based on the
test set.
Step7: Perform Comparison Evaluation of the experimental performance results obtained for
each classifier.
